This application was created to act as a library of customizable and reusable components. As I build applications and find interesting components I will continue to add them to this project. As more components are added this will speed up development of unique looking apps as I will be able to simply drop these components into an application and use React context or a theme engine to quickly change the look of all components at once.

This is a React application that utilizes Styled Components to apply dynamic styles to each component and Material Icons for clean svg images.

## How to install/use:
1. Clone/Fork the repository
2. Use `$npm install` to install all dependencies and `$npm start` to view
3. Copy desired component files into whatever project you need them in
4. Theme components in your application using examples provided in App.js or leave default styles

## Optimizations
- Use theme provider to supply custom values as an alternative to a settings object. This should reduce code duplication when using multiple components in an app and make plug/play easier for applications already using Theme Provider.

## Lessons Learned
- Many CSS tips and tricks within each component such as animations, sizing, and responsiveness.

## Resources
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kepowob">Kevin Powell</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers">Online Tutorials</a> have been awesome resources for design and information. I will try to leave links to videos I used for specific components inside of the component files themselves.
